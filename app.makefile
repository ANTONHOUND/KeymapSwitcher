## BeOS Generic Makefile v2.2 ##

## Fill in this file to specify the project being created, and the referenced
## makefile-engine will do all of the hard work for you.  This handles both
## Intel and PowerPC builds of the BeOS.

## Application Specific Settings ---------------------------------------------
#RC=/boot/develop/tools/rc
RC=rc

# specify the name of the binary
NAME=KeymapSwitcher

# specify the type of binary
#	APP:	Application
#	SHARED:	Shared library or add-on
#	STATIC:	Static library archive
#	DRIVER: Kernel Driver
TYPE=APP

APP_MIME_SIG=x-vnd.Nexus-KeymapSwitcher

#	add support for new Pe and Eddie features
#	to fill in generic makefile

#%{
# @src->@ 

#	specify the source files to use
#	full paths or paths relative to the makefile can be included
# 	all files, regardless of directory, will have their object
#	files created in the common object directory.
#	Note that this means this makefile will not work correctly
#	if two source files with the same name (source.c or source.cpp)
#	are included from different directories.  Also note that spaces
#	in folder names do not work well with this makefile.
SRCS=DeskView.cpp\
	KeymapSwitcher.cpp\
	Replicator.cpp\
	SettingsWindow.cpp\
	Settings.cpp

#	specify the resource files to use
#	full path or a relative path to the resource file can be used.

#	end support for Pe and Eddie

#	specify additional libraries to link against
#	there are two acceptable forms of library specifications
#	-	if your library follows the naming pattern of:
#		libXXX.so or libXXX.a you can simply specify XXX
#		library: libbe.so entry: be
#		
#	- 	if your library does not follow the standard library
#		naming scheme you need to specify the path to the library
#		and it's name
#		library: my_lib.a entry: my_lib.a or path/my_lib.a
LIBS=be stdc++ locale localestub

#	specify additional paths to directories following the standard
#	libXXX.so or libXXX.a naming scheme.  You can specify full paths
#	or paths relative to the makefile.  The paths included may not
#	be recursive, so include all of the paths where libraries can
#	be found.  Directories where source files are found are
#	automatically included.
LIBPATHS= 

#	additional paths to look for system headers
#	thes use the form: #include <header>
#	source file directories are NOT auto-included here
SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATHS = 

#	additional paths to look for local headers
#	thes use the form: #include "header"
#	source file directories are automatically included
LOCAL_INCLUDE_PATHS = 

#	specify the level of optimization that you desire
#	NONE, SOME, FULL
OPTIMIZE=FULL

#	specify any preprocessor symbols to be defined.  The symbols will not
#	have their values set automatically; you must supply the value (if any)
#	to use.  For example, setting DEFINES to "DEBUG=1" will cause the
#	compiler option "-DDEBUG=1" to be used.  Setting DEFINES to "DEBUG"
#	would pass "-DDEBUG" on the compiler's command line.
DEFINES=

#	specify special warning levels
#	if unspecified default warnings will be used
#	NONE = supress all warnings
#	ALL = enable all warnings
WARNINGS=ALL

#	specify whether image symbols will be created
#	so that stack crawls in the debugger are meaningful
#	if TRUE symbols will be created
SYMBOLS=

#	specify debug settings
#	if TRUE will allow application to be run from a source-level
#	debugger.  Note that this will disable all optimzation.
DEBUGGER=

#	specify additional compiler flags for all files
COMPILER_FLAGS =

#	specify additional linker flags
LINKER_FLAGS =

#	specify the version of this particular item
#	(for example, -app 3 4 0 d 0 -short 340 -long "340 "`echo -n -e '\302\251'`"1999 GNU GPL") 
#	This may also be specified in a resource.
APP_VERSION = 

#	(for TYPE == DRIVER only) Specify desired location of driver in the /dev
#	hierarchy. Used by the driverinstall rule. E.g., DRIVER_PATH = video/usb will
#	instruct the driverinstall rule to place a symlink to your driver's binary in
#	~/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb, so that your driver will appear at
#	/dev/video/usb when loaded. Default is "misc".
